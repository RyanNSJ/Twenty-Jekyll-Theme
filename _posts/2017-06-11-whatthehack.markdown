What the Hack is aiming to be an annual design-centric hackathon organised in SUTD. We wanted to break from the traditional themes of conventional hackathons, and create a down-to-earth hackathon solving real-world problems. With the themes Space, Education, Environment and Security the Hackathon aims to solve hyper-relevant issues with the best brains and best problem-hacking tech available.

This was one of my many design projects in SUTD. Definitely believed in the spirit and head organizers of this initiative and decided to lend some front-end design help to the event. I helped to create the logo, theme, website and other publicity materials for this event.
