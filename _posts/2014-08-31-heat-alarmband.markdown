A smart, reactive exercise armband hoping to solve the prominemt problem of heatstroke and heat exhaustion during National Service. It takes the strain off the limited number of instructors and assists servicemen to lookout for one another, exponentially increasing the number of eyes and ears watching out for servicemen.

A student design project, the crowd-sourced safety net utilizes temperature, sweat and HR sensors, and alerts all users in the vicinity if health stats exceeds safety thresholds or shows key indicators of heat exhaution.

Moving forward, the device could be further improved to consider age, gender, prior health conditions and continually revise its threshold values to allow national servicemen to safely push themselves to their limits.

Throughout the project I worked together with reknowed product designer Suranga C. Nanayakkara and an awesome product development team.
